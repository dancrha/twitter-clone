# Twitter Clone Web App

This is a Twitter clone web application built with React.js and Firebase. It allows users to sign up, log in, post tweets, follow other users, and view a timeline of tweets from users they follow.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can sign up for a new account with their email and password.
- User Authentication: Users can log in to their account using their registered email and password.
- Post Tweets: Logged-in users can compose and post tweets.
- Follow Users: Users can choose to follow other users and receive their tweets in their timeline.
- Timeline: Users can view a timeline of tweets from the users they follow.
- User Profile: Each user has a profile page displaying their tweets and follower/following counts.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- Firebase: Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform providing authentication, database, and hosting services.
- Firebase Authentication: Used for user registration and login.
- Firebase Firestore: Cloud-hosted NoSQL database for storing tweet data.
- Firebase Hosting: Used to deploy the web application.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-clone.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```
cd twitter-clone
npm install
```
3. Set up Firebase:

- Create a new Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore in the Firebase project.
- Obtain the Firebase configuration values (API Key, Auth Domain, etc.).
- Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the Firebase configuration values:

  ```
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
  ```

4. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```
The application should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Open the web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to Firebase hosting, follow these steps:

1. Build the optimized production bundle:
```
npm run build
```
2. Install the Firebase CLI if you haven't already:
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
3. Initialize Firebase in the project:
```
firebase init
```
Select the Firebase features you want to set up (hosting) and follow the prompts to configure the Firebase project.

4. Deploy the application to Firebase hosting:
```
firebase deploy
```
After the deployment is complete, you will receive a hosting URL where the application is deployed.
